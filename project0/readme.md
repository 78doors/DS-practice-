### Project description
Guess the computer's number in as few tries as possible


### Case to solve
We need to write a program that guesses a number in the minimum number of tries

### Terms of competition: 
- the computer sets a number from 0 to 100 and we have to guess it, that is, write a program that guesses the number.

- the algorithm takes into account whether a random number is higher or lower than the one we need. 

### Quality metric
The results are assessed by the average number of attempts at 1,000 repetitions.

### What do we practice? 
We learn to write a good code via Python.
