### Project description    
Computer guesses the random number using the minimum amount of attempts

### What task do we solve?   
We need to write a program that will help the computer to guess the random number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Conditions:**  
- The computer thinks of an integer from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it. By "guess" we mean "write a program that guesses a number".
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.

**Quality metric**     
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions

**What do we practice?**     
We Learn to write good python code
